Spreadsheet Application (Java + JUnit tests + JavaSwing/JavaFX)

It is a spreadsheet-like application using Java. 
The project involved migrating the GUI from JavaSwing to JavaFX, implementing spreadsheet functions like MEAN and MEDIAN, and adding file-handling functionality for saving and loading spreadsheets.

Task:
Developing the backend logic for calculations (ADDITION, DIVISION, MEAN, MEDIAN and so on), creating a new JavaFX GUI, and adding file-handling features (Save/Open). 
Additionally, I wrote robust JUnit tests to validate the functionality of my methods.

Action:
Backend Development: 
I implemented the MEAN and MEDIAN functions, modifying the parser to support these operations. 
I also extended the backend to handle file I/O, allowing users to save and load spreadsheet data.

Testing and Debugging: 
I developed comprehensive JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of both the spreadsheet functions and the file-handling system, catching edge cases and ensuring robust functionality.

Frontend Development (JavaFX): 
I migrated the user interface from JavaSwing to JavaFX, ensuring a smooth, intuitive, and visually consistent interface across both versions.

Integration: 
I successfully integrated the frontend with the backend, ensuring the new JavaFX GUI could communicate seamlessly with the calculation functions and file-handling features.

Result
The project was completed successfully, demonstrating my ability to handle both frontend and backend development tasks. My JUnit tests effectively caught bugs early, ensuring that the application was stable and functional. This project strengthened my backend development skills and showcased my ability to integrate unit testing into the development process.
